--       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
--       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

--
--       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
--       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
--       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
--       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
--
--       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
--       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
--       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
--       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
--       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
--       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
--       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
--
--       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
--       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
--       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
--       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
--       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

--       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
--
--       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
--       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
--       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
--
--    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
--       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
--       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
--       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
--       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
--
--    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

--       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
--       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
--       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
--       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
--       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
--       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
--       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
--       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
--       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
--       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
--       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
--       as of the date such litigation is filed.
--
--    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
--       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
--       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
--       meet the following conditions:
--
--       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
--           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
--
--       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
--           stating that You changed the files; and
--
--       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
--           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
--           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
--           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
--           the Derivative Works; and
--
--       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
--           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
--           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
--           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
--           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
--           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
--           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
--           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
--           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
--           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
--           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
--           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
--           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
--           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
--           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
--           as modifying the License.
--
--       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
--       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
--       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
--       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
--       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
--       the conditions stated in this License.
--
--    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
--       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
--       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
--       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
--       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
--       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
--       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
--
--    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
--       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
--       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
--       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
--
--    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
--       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
--       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
--       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
--       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
--       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
--       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
--       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
--       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
--
--    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
--       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
--       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
--       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
--       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
--       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
--       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
--       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
--       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
--       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
--       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
--
--    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
--       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
--       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
--       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
--       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
--       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
--       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
--       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
--       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
--       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

--
-- The above license applies to all parts of Neovim except (1) parts that were
-- contributed under the Vim license and (2) externally maintained libraries.
--
-- The externally maintained libraries used by Neovim are:
--
--   - Klib: a Generic Library in C. MIT/X11 license.

--
-- ====
--
-- Any parts of Neovim that were contributed under the Vim license are licensed
-- under the Vim license unless the copyright holder gave permission to license
-- those contributions under the Apache 2.0 license.
--
-- The Vim license follows:
--
-- VIM LICENSE
--
-- I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
--     that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
--     unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
--     include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
--     that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
--     examples and Vim scripts.
--
-- II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
--     including executables and/or source code, when the following four
--     conditions are met:
--     1) This license text must be included unmodified.
--     2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
--        a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
-- 	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
-- 	  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
-- 	  must make your changes, including source code, available to the
-- 	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
-- 	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
-- 	  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
-- 	  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
-- 	  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
-- 	  The current maintainers are listed here: https://github.com/orgs/vim/people.
-- 	  If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
-- 	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely
-- 	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
-- 	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
-- 	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
--        b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
-- 	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
-- 	  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
-- 	  text under a) applies to those changes.
--        c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
-- 	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
-- 	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
-- 	  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
-- 	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
--        d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
-- 	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
-- 	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
-- 	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
-- 	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
-- 	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
-- 	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
-- 	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
-- 	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
-- 	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
-- 	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
-- 	    available to him.
-- 	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
-- 	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
-- 	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long
-- 	    as possible.
--        e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
-- 	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
-- 	  any later version.
--     3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
--        command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
--        is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
--        under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
--        not conflict with the license used for the changes.
--     4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
--        removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
--        corrections.
--
-- III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
--      the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
--      maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
--      by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
--      If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
--      context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
--      <maintainer@vim.org>
--
-- IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
--      sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
--      license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came
--      with, at your option.
